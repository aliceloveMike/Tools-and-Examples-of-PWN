robustness in general
speed enhancements, if possible (remote serial, plaintext protocols are not particularly efficient)
more configurable (e.g., listening port)
just enough user-space support to be useful
some custom cmds (dmesg, list processes, vm event stats, etc)
implement windbg protocol (stubbed currently, but non-functional)
